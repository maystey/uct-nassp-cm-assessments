#ODE_solving #root_finding 
In this method a boundary value problem is solved by converting it to an initial value problem by introducing a variable initial condition. A root finding method is used to determine the value for this initial value which gives a solution for the boundary value problem.

This requires students to be able to think about using the ODE solver to generate a function.
