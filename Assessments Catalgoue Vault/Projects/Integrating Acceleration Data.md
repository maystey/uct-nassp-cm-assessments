# Uses and Variations

## 2024 - Project 2

Water rocket. Vertical acceleration recorded. Error estimation and uncertainty propagation used. Maximum heights of multiple rockets determined and compared within expanded uncertainty intervals.

Note the "improved" version of this project, which is a re-write including material from the help sessions. 

Note that due to an error in the initial solutions, the uncertainties are impractically small.

## 2023 - Project 2

Two wheeled RC vehicle. Comparing path reconstruction from horizontal linear + rotational acceleration and rpm for each wheel.

## 2021 - Project 2

Ball rolling down a slope, with x and y acceleration data recorded. Reconstruct slopes.

## 2020 - Project 4

Water rocket. Vertical acceleration recorded.
